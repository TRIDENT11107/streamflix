## Introduction

StreamFlix is a personal project intended for educational purposes and to demonstrate front-end development skills. It's not meant to be a production-ready application or a replacement for Netflix.  This project focuses on replicating the user interface and basic browsing functionality.

## Features

*   **Responsive Design:** Adapts to different screen sizes for optimal viewing on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
*   **Netflix-like UI:**  Mimics the look and feel of the Netflix interface, providing a familiar browsing experience.
*   **Dynamic Content Loading (Planned):**  (In future implementations)  Will fetch movie data from an API or database to populate the movie listings.
*   **Search Functionality (Planned):** (In future implementations) Enables users to search for specific movies or genres.
*   **User Authentication (Planned):** (In future implementations)  Will allow users to create accounts and manage their watchlists.

## Technologies Used

*   **HTML:** Structuring the web page content.
*   **CSS:** Styling the application and creating the Netflix-like layout.
*   **JavaScript:** Adding interactivity and dynamic behavior.
*   **(Planned) API Integration:** For fetching movie data.

## Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/streamflix.git](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/streamflix.git)
    ```
    (Replace `YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username)

2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd streamflix
    ```

3.  Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Usage

Simply open the `index.html` file in your browser. You should see the StreamFlix interface.  Currently, the movie listings are static placeholders.  Future updates will implement dynamic content loading.

## Future Enhancements

*   Implement dynamic content loading from an API (e.g., TMDB).
*   Add search functionality.
*   Implement user authentication and personalized watchlists.
*   Improve the user interface and add more features.
*   Backend integration (if desired).
